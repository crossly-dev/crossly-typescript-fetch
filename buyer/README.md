## @crossly/buyer-fetch@1.0.0

This generator creates TypeScript/JavaScript client that utilizes [Fetch API](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/). The generated Node module can be used in the following environments:

Environment
* Node.js
* Webpack
* Browserify

Language level
* ES5 - you must have a Promises/A+ library installed
* ES6

Module system
* CommonJS
* ES6 module system

It can be used in both TypeScript and JavaScript. In TypeScript, the definition should be automatically resolved via `package.json`. ([Reference](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typings-for-npm-packages.html))

### Building

To build and compile the typescript sources to javascript use:
```
npm install
npm run build
```

### Publishing

First build the package then run ```npm publish```

### Consuming

navigate to the folder of your consuming project and run one of the following commands.

_published:_

```
npm install @crossly/buyer-fetch@1.0.0 --save
```

_unPublished (not recommended):_

```
npm install PATH_TO_GENERATED_PACKAGE --save

## Where things are

| what | where |
|---|---|
| one class per API group (`OrdersApi`, `ListingsApi`, …) | `src/apis/` |
| one model per response/request type, grouped by product area | `src/models/<area>/` |

The area is the word after the verb in the model name: `GetVaultLendResponse`
is under `vault`, `ListOrdersItem` under `order`. Areas with only a handful of
models, and small shared shapes, are under `common`.

Models are named after where they appear: `GetOrderResponse` is what `getOrder`
returns, `GetOrderResponseDataLines` the type of its `data.lines`, `ListOrdersItem`
one row of `listOrders`. A type several endpoints share appears ONCE, under the
first name it was given — or, for small shared shapes like `{ ok }`, a name from
its fields (`OkResponse`). There is no per-model doc page: the model source file
is the reference, and your editor will jump to it.
